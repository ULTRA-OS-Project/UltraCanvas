#### 2026-06-12 *0.2.8*
- Slideshow demo: reworked the options panel into a labelled-row grid (label column on the left, wrapping option buttons on the right) grouped Controls / Indicator / Indicator edge / Fade style / Panel layout / Image / Letterbox fill.

- Slideshow: indicators can now hug any edge via `SlideshowIndicatorEdge` (Top/Bottom rows, Left/Right stacked columns)
- Slideshow: added `SlideVertical` and `ZoomFade` transition styles
- Slideshow: configurable image fitting for mismatched images — `imageFit` (Cover auto-crop, Contain, Fill, ScaleDown, NoScale), an `imageFocus` focal point that picks which part survives a crop, and `gapFill` for letterboxed images (background color, dedicated letterbox color, or a zoomed image backdrop)
- Slideshow demo: added pickers for info-panel layout, indicator edge, image fit, crop focus and letterbox fill, plus the new transitions

- Shard very long lines to speed up TextArea on big files.
  Lines longer than 4000 codepoints are split at a break char

  Known problems: 
    if line has no break chars (very rare case) it will splitted at 12000 char boundary,
    attempt to glue that lines (backspace or delete) will cause reshard (resplit) again
    and it will splitted at same boundary, visually it will looks like delete/backspace did not work
